= Default WordPress Login =

Login credentials are validated and auth cookie is generated upon login. Each visit to the site by a logged in user is identified by checking the auth cookie formed upon login.

HTTP is stateless. Session is not generated connecting WordPress and logged in user. WordPress has no idea of who is currently logged in by default.

If another person enters the same credentials as a logged in user, the latter one will also given a auth cookie. This default WordPress behavior makes it possible to have two logged in users with same login credentials to the same user account.
